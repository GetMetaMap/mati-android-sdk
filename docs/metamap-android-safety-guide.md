# Android Data Safety Guide

## Google Playâ€™s data disclosure requirements
Google Playâ€™Â [Data safety section](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/05/new-safety-section-in-google-play-will.html) is a developer-provided disclosure for an app's data-collection, sharing, and security practices.

Use this page to help you complete the requirements for this data disclosure with respect to your usage of MetaMapâ€™s SDKs, including whether and how our SDK handles end-user data, and any applicable configurations or invocations you can control as the app developer.

We at MetaMap aim to be as transparent as possible, but as the app developer you are responsible for your response to Google Play's Data safety section form.

## Collected data
The following lists the end-user data collected by the latest version of the MetaMap SDK. The data collection falls into two classes:

- Automatic collection
Data collected automatically without invoking specific methods or classes in your app
- Dashboard-configured collection
Data collected based on your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.getmati.com/) configuration of the SDK. In many cases, the data collected by the SDK is defined by your app's dashboard configuration.

UseÂ [Android's guide about data types](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/collect-share)Â to help you determine which data type best describes the collected data to complete your data disclosure. In your data disclosure, make sure to also account for how your specific app shares and uses the collected data.

> ðŸ“˜Data Encryption
> 
> All of the user data collected by the SDK is encrypted in transit using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.

### Data collected depending on your Dashboard configuration

Depending on how you configure the MetaMap [Dashboard](https://dashboard.getmati.com) your app may collect end-user data that needs to be included in your data disclosure.
